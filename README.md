# Tracker-COVID-19
This React capstone project is about building a Mobile Web Application to check a list of metrics (numeric values) that I will create making use of React and Redux. Thanks to the COVID-19 metrics I was able to fetch data by using Fetch API, which helped me to get the all the stats per country needed for the project.
